    "This notebook provides a summary analysis of internet upload speeds by county across Vermont and New Hampshire.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Why look at upload speeds?__  \n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses and entrepreneurs rely on strong upload and download speeds for basic operations and communications, such as video conferencing (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Google Hangouts, Skype), hard drive backups, cloud applications (Google Docs, Dropbox, iCloud), voice over IP (VoIP), telephone service, and attachments on outgoing email, to name a few. By contrast, home internet users care most about download speeds to satisfy typical consumer needs, such as watching movies on-demand. Lines blur in the case of remotely located employees, and businesses seeking workers and offices in well-connected areas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__How good is broadband in VT and NH overall with respect to other states?__  \n",
    "\n",
    "In its 2018 analysis [\"Internet Access Rankings\"](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/infrastructure/internet-access) (U.S. News & World Report, 2018), Vermont and New Hampshire ranked 13th and 14th overall based on composite measures of broadband internet access. However, lower rankings of 22nd for VT and 34th for NH were given for access to ultra-fast internet of at least 1 gigabit speeds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Which counties across VT and NH provide the best upload speeds?__  \n",
    "\n",
    "To provide this analysis, the following script acquires, cleans and blends two data sources, one for county-level population data from the U.S. Census, and another for broadband availability, specifically Maximum Upload Speed by County. The output dataset(s) are used to develop mapping applications in CARTO. A derived measure of \"Population-weighted upload speed\" supports a per-capita comparison analysis by county, potentially useful when considering shared-bandwidth technologies like DSL.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted upload speeds can be calculated in various ways. Is a larger population better or worse? Should the weighted metric support comparisons between counties in different states, or only within a given state? The following are two of many possible weighting calculations. The first is a max upload speed (Mbps) per capita based on county population size (county_pop_size) which can be used to highlight counties with smaller populations and higher upload speeds. The second is based on max upload speed (Mbps) by the county percentage of state population (county_pop_pct) which would best support within-state but not between-state comparisons:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $max\\_upload\\_wt = max\\_upload / county\\_pop\\_size$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "> $max\\_upload\\_wt\\_pct = max\\_upload / county\\_pop\\_pct$\n",
    "\n",
    "Between these two, per capita weighting by population size is preferred for between-state comparisons of upload speeds relative to county populuations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals & Significance.**  This small execerise could be expanded to a scoring algorithm(s) for identifying  locations based on multiple criteria. This could be enhanced by modeling covariate relationships that take into account measures of people and place--both objective and subjective--that can collectively represent opportunities for rural innovation."
